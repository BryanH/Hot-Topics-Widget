Hot Topics Widget
=================

This widget will display a manually-generated list of categories; each category name will link to a page of posts in that category.

## Installing
* Copy the directory into your `wp-content/plugin` directory.
* Go into your Wordpress admin screen and activate the plugin.

## Using
* Go to your widgets screen and drag the widget to the sidebar.
* Enter the title to display at the beginning of the list
* Enter the category names you wish to display. You can enter categories that don't exist. Capitalization doesn't have to match, either.

If you enter a category that doesn't exist, Wordpress will still display the name, but won't make it a link.

## Uninstalling
Delete the directory from the `wp-content/plugin` directory.
